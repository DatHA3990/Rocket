This is software for a rocket built by me. I've always admired 
SpaceX and this project is based off of their re-usable booster. 
My rocket will takeoff, do a "re-entry" burn, then land 
vertically. I hope that this project will maybe get me a job 
at SpaceX. Hopefully, I'll become a flight software engineer!

Here is the flight plan:
	Pre-launch:
		Wait until all is go for launch.
	Launch:
		Lifttoff on a normal hobby rocket motor.
	Re-entry:
		Ignite a custom motor at the right moment so that
		we don't crash onto the ground.
	Landing:
		Land vertically. Shutdown all systems.
